It seems tied to a post-update glitch in the inventory API endpoint connecting to the database.\n\nQuick questions: What's your exact Nosco CRM version (Settings > About)? Any recent custom integrations or config changes? Can other modules like sales or contacts load fine?\n\nIn the interim, try accessing via incognito mode or our staging server mirror at staging.nosco.com (same credentials).

Also, check if your mobile app license includes inventory (v2.4.1 works there).\n\n#NOSCO-4567 is with devs for a hotfix patch, targeted for release by EOD tomorrow.
